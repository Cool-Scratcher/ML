    <h1>Introduction ü§ùüèº</h1>
    <p>Machine learning. It‚Äôs useful, works well, is necessary to the future, can do EPIC THINGS, and is everywhere you look today. It‚Äôs very important today and will be even more important in the future. As time progresses, problems arise, and machine learning will be humanity‚Äôs secret weapon against these problems. We have lived in a mere sliver of time; we have a long way to go ‚Äî and machine learning will assist humanity in all times of trouble. Do I sound wise? I‚Äôm trying to sound really smart. Am I succeeding? I hope so‚Ä¶ </p>
    
    <h1>Part I: What and How</h1>
    <h2>What Is Machine Learning?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is machines‚Ä¶ learning. By <mark>programming</mark> machines to be able to be taught to learn (no, that‚Äôs not a typo), we‚Äôre helping our future generations. If you think about AI, you might realize that AI is similar to ML. However, the two things are different. <mark>Artificial intelligence</mark> is a broader concept ‚Äî it‚Äôs the idea that someday, machines will be able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider ‚Äúsmart.‚Äù However, machine learning is an application of AI and is the idea that if machines are given access to data ‚Äî or samples (we‚Äôll get to that, don‚Äôt worry) ‚Äî then they would be able to learn for themselves.</p>
    
    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p>Machine learning works by being given <mark>data samples</mark> ‚Äî in the format of whatever the machine is trying to learn. For instance, if the machine is trying to identify images of a corgi (I don‚Äôt know, okay? My creative juices have run out!) it would have pictures of corgis and pictures of other dog breeds. A human would classify these samples (this image is a corgi, this is also a corgi, so is this ‚Äî oh, that‚Äôs a german shepherd) and the AI would scan them using epic AI code rules thingies. When given new images, it will be able to classify them by itself ‚Äî essentially, it learned things!</p>

    <h1>Part II: Impact</h1>
    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>All things considered, machine learning is not a new idea. It‚Äôs actually been around since the 1990s. Before that, even! Anyways, machine learning is VITAL to the future. It will really influence our future lives and everything. Machine learning will eventually power <mark>robots</mark> alongside machine learning. It will give robots the ability to be very humanlike and have natural conversation. It will help <mark>autopilots</mark> on airplanes and eventually rocket ships be more accurate and precise.</p>

    <h2>The Future Is Now</h2>
    <p>All of this, however, will happen in the future. Machine learning today will‚Ä¶ well, it‚Äôll probably blow your mind (probably).</p>

    <p><mark>Deep learning</mark>, <mark>neural networks</mark>, machine learning, artificial intelligence‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre all very similar, and they all are super cool and powerful. With it, you‚Äôre able to generate images of nonexistent people‚Ä¶</p>
    <img src="thispersondoesnotexist.gif" alt="a gif of me generating a bunch of people that don't actually exist!">
    <p>cats... (no, you didn't read that incorrectly. AI can generate CATS that don't exist!!)</p>
    <img src="thiscatdoesnotexist.gif" alt="a gif of me generating a bunch of cats that don't actually exist!">
    <p>horses... (admittely this one is kind of glitchy)</p>
    <img src="thishorsedoesnotexist.gif" alt="a gif of me generating a bunch of horses that don't actually exist!">
    <p>and even CHEMICALS:</p>
    <img src="thischemicaldoesnotexist.gif" alt="a gif of me generating a bunch of chemicals that don't actually exist!">
    <p>Keep in mind that all these <i>don‚Äôt actually exist in real life</i>! They‚Äôre generated by the computer on-the-spot.</p>

    <p>Now for some things that YOURS TRULY made!!</p>

    <p>What about a MASK?!</p>

    <h1>Part III: Logic</h1>
    <h2>It's Everywhere!</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning is everywhere. It‚Äôs seen in your day-to-day life and is crucial to your workflow. Even if ‚Äúyour workflow‚Äù means sitting on a couch binge watching <i>Stranger Things</i>.</p>
    <p><mark>Virtual Assistants</mark> (virtual hinderers to the pessimistic) are super useful today, and they are directly powered by machine learning. How do you think that Siri knows that you‚Äôre calling for it? Obviously, it‚Äôs using machine learning to identify when you say ‚ÄúSiri.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Oh, and we spend a lot of time on social media like Instagram, because they‚Äôre super pleasing and although perhaps not the most useful thing, really fun to scroll through. However, did you ever stop and consider how Instagram predicts what posts you‚Äôd like to see? Or how LinkedIn suggests jobs or very accurately predicts who you know? Or how YouTube ‚Äî eh, you get it. Again, machine learning!</p>
    <p>Your house is likely protected by video surveillance systems. When the system detects the sound of breaking glass or senses a break-in, it alerts you. This happens through ‚Äî you guessed it ‚Äî machine learning. Tada!</p>
    <p>From chatbots on websites to social media suggestions, ML is everywhere.</p>

    <h2>Why, Though?</h2>
    <p>Let‚Äôs stop and ask ourselves something. We‚Äôve covered the basics of machine learning, learned how important it is, and talked about it a bit.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>What‚Äôs the ultimate purpose of machine learning, other than to help future people? Obviously it is SUPER NECESSARY for future people to, y‚Äôknow, keep living.</p>
    <p>Honestly, to ask why machine learning is learned today is a complicated question. The answer, in its simplest form, is that machine learning is sought after. There are plenty of jobs that are really well-paying from top companies that require you to know machine learning fully ‚Äî Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, <mark>Facial Recognition</mark>, <mark>Virtual/Augmented Reality</mark>‚Ä¶ all these things are crucial for today and the future.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Machine learning is everywhere. It is super important to the future, does EPIC things today, and learning it can really open up opportunities (no, I‚Äôm not talking about jobs or nerdy things like that! I‚Äôm saying that machine learning can help you. Imagine training AI to identify specifically what you‚Äôre doing wrong in your workflow and giving suggestions to improve it so that your grades improve. <i>That‚Äôs</i> what I‚Äôm talking about!)</p>
    <p>I hope you learned something (though I didn‚Äôt for some odd reason).</p>

    <h1>Glossary</h1>
    <p><mark>Machine Learning</mark> - Dude! Do you really need a definition for machine learning? Like, you just read a bunch about it! I am not defining this again. Sorry.</p>
    <p><mark>Programming</mark> - Giving a computer instructions. Seriously, that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs not that hard (well, eventually it gets hard, but eh. It‚Äôs easy with challenges.)</p>
    <p><mark>Artificial Intelligence</mark> - DUDE! I ALSO defined that in this article website thingy. Really? Well, in case, you somehow already forgot, artificial intelligence is an application of artificial intelligence that directly relates to machines ‚Äúthinking.‚Äù</p>
    <p><mark>Data samples</mark> - samples‚Ä¶ of data‚Ä¶ that are examples for the machine to scan and classify.</p>
    <p><mark>Robots</mark> - A machine that is capable of carrying out a complex series of instructions. They sometimes resemble humans, though they are significantly creepier than humans.</p>
    <p><mark>Autopilot</mark> - A machine that when activated, flies an airplane or rocket ship by itself with little to no human supervision/help.</p>
    <p><mark>Deep Learning</mark> - A subset of machine learning that includes methods of artificial neural networks (we‚Äôre coming to that). It specifically refers to networks of huge computing power.</p>
    <p><mark>Neural Network</mark> - A network (duh) or circuit (not duh) of neurons (duh). Neural networks can recognize relationships in a set of data through a process that is similar to the way the human brain works. Basically, it‚Äôs a network full of thousands of fake neurons.</p>
    <p><mark>Virtual Assistants</mark> - Assistants/hinderers that are virtual. They help from time-from-time, and occasionally make you feel like punching them. In all seriousness, though, they were a significant milestone in machine learning.</p>
    <p><mark>Facial Recognition</mark> - Machines recognizing your face using machine learning</p>
    <p><mark>Virtual Reality</mark> - Replacing your vision with an artificial one. It's one of my favorite things in the world.</p>
    <p><mark>Augmented Reality</mark> - Replacing PARTS your vision with PARTS of an artificial one. Basically taking fantastical or nonexistent things and placing them in your vision.</p>
    <p><mark>Chatbot</mark> - A bot. That chats. What else would it be?!</p>
